# Add a note, then reload the web page; the note's still there!

## Motivation
To try out a relatively new tool for client-side storage: **IndexedDB**


An IndexedDB wrapper, **Dexie.js** was used in the construction of the app.

Check the package out here: https://github.com/dfahlander/Dexie.js/

## Features 
- Unlimited notes may be added.
- Notes may be deleted.
- Application is tied to the user's device, so signing-in is not required.

## Usage
1. Download this app into your own PC using `git clone` or by manually downloading the zip folder.
2. Navigate to the root directory and run `yarn install` to download the app's dependencies.
3. Run `yarn start` to run the app in development, open http://localhost:3000/ to view it in the browser.
